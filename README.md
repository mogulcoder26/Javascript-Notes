The ```console. log()``` method outputs a message to the web console. The message may be a single string (with optional substitution values), or it may be any one or more JavaScript objects.


```string.length()``` is a function that logs the strings length .
```string.slice(0,x)``` is a function that logs out strings sliced version from 0th index to x-1th index.
